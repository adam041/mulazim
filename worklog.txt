Work list

-core logic
    - QA
        >>   irregulars in forms after 1
        OK   squelch prefix/suffix on null forms (i.e. form 7 passives, recipient)
        >    function conjPassivePast(root, formNum) // form 9
        OK   implement word object in earlier irregular functions? ... show user type of irregular verb?
        OK   nouns.js remove -  Unreachable 'break' after 'return'.
        OK   chunk (v4) to parse vowels & markings...need for debugging doubled verbs, catching vowel surplus in other use-cases
                ok   > compare output short vowels to exemplars; trace discrepancies

     > QA conjugations
        OK  assimilative verbs

        OK  hollow verbs ?
            OK regulars in active tenses
            OK irregular in active tenses
            OK? later past tenses have beginning of stem chopped off >>>> USE String.Prototype.replaceAt() vs char position of root
                String.prototype.replaceAt=function(index, char) {return this.substr(0, index) + char + this.substr(index+char.length);}
                Line806
            OK (auto-squelched) passive tenses have doubled vowels

        ~ defective verbs ?
resumeworkhere! they-f has sukkun over waaw in active imperfect...should not be there.  no trailing ar_a on they-m.

        > doubled verbs ?
            OK form 1  -- rad 2 takes place of shadda
            ?? later forms - need more data to validate...dupe vowels squelched
            !! NOUN conj needs to stay regular in form2/5

        ~ hamza verbs ?
            change vowel to match consonant, or hamza consonant to match preceeding vowel (grammatical!) - check hollow present logic

-styling/css
    OK   style chosen select x 2.  hide search on subject.  increase height & width.  add label.
    OK   tweak CSS from js console w/ jQ, then lock in

-backend / data quality
    - data entry for imperative...jussive? > six ways, varies by subject (person/gender)
    - Regex root from masdar? > could manually run through patterns, but current option is simpler
    - correlation b/t form 1/2/3 masdar > no?
    - dual
    - irregulars with many forms for QA
    - handle irregular within conj script?
