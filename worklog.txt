Work list

!!!
- would it be easier (hollow irreg & doubled irreg & jussive) to check for sukkun following rad3, then apply script.
BAU is check for subject / characters that would cause sukkun to be written.
- write out cheat card for data entry - esp. masdar codes...document on git read.me too?

???
- would doubled be easier to handle with rad3 being written instead of shadda? - look at later forms ?
- jussive/imperative
- "polishing" function for QA - de-dupe vowels, ?complement long/short vowels?, collapse alifs, etc
- segmentate?


needed but boring
- moar data
- QA hamza, QA assimilative > late
- req gather f2-f10
    !!!!! switch() forms before going into irregularizer? // 'arabic irregular verbs'.numbers
- css for ios
- irregular handling of masdar; nouns


nice to have
-? segmentate (9) Suffix < OuterLeft < R3 < InnerLeft < R2 < InnerRight < R1 < OuterRight < Prefix
- constants as one big object? or lotsa small vars? ar_A vs r.A vs ar.A vs r.translit(a,r,b)

-core logic
    - QA
        >>   QA irregulars in forms after 1
        OK   squelch prefix/suffix on null forms (i.e. form 7 passives, recipient)
        >    function conjPassivePast(root, formNum) // form 9
        OK   implement word object in earlier irregular functions? ... show user type of irregular verb?
        OK   nouns.js remove -  Unreachable 'break' after 'return'.
        OK   chunk (v4) to parse vowels & markings...need for debugging doubled verbs, catching vowel surplus in other use-cases
                ok   > compare output short vowels to exemplars; trace discrepancies
        OK   have option to print ALL conjugations from all subjects
        OK   Added codes for form1 masdar; cleaned up code for form 2/3
        OK   regex match one of multiple unicode chars - collapse اا into آ

     > QA conjugations
        OK  assimilative verbs
>>          !  fix form 8 (also masdar broke) active present outputs يَتَصِلُ
                    ...should be يَتَواصِل

        OK  hollow verbs ?
            OK regulars in active tenses
            OK irregular in active tenses
            OK? later past tenses have beginning of stem chopped off >>>> USE String.Prototype.replaceAt() vs char position of root
                String.prototype.replaceAt=function(index, char) {return this.substr(0, index) + char + this.substr(index+char.length);}
                Line806
            OK (auto-squelched) passive tenses have doubled vowels

        ~ defective verbs ?
            OK in present tense, need to prune lead char of suffix
>> resume >>  ?? past tense, especially they x2

        > doubled verbs ?
            OK form 1  -- rad 2 takes place of shadda
            ?? later forms - need more data to validate...dupe vowels squelched
            !! NOUN conj needs to stay regular in form2/5

        ~ hamza verbs ?
            change vowel to match consonant, or hamza consonant to match preceeding vowel (grammatical!) - check hollow present logic

-styling/css
    OK   style chosen select x 2.  hide search on subject.  increase height & width.  add label.
    OK   tweak CSS from js console w/ jQ, then lock in

-backend / data quality
    - SQL join / js to combine & de-dupe both sheets...translations not read if backend has a dupe
    - on 500
        - defective - write Ya, not alif maqsura
        - doubled - using shadda on orig (write out both on 500)
        - quadrilateral (offload to separate sheet a.t.t.)
        - جوب - two meanings/rad2 conjugations in form 10

>>>> data quality standards
    - doubled roots get shadda as rad3, not a repeat of rad2
    - roots that get hyphens for form 1 vowels: hollow, doubled
    - defective roots get ? in rad3

    - data entry for imperative...jussive? > six ways, varies by subject (person/gender)
    - dual
    - handle irregular within conj script?
    - Regex root from masdar? > could manually run through patterns, but current option is simpler
        - correlation b/t form 1/2/3 masdar > no?
