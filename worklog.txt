Work list
! chunk (v4) to parse vowels & markings...need for debugging doubled verbs, catching vowel surplus in other use-cases

!> de-duper needs to print shadda before all vowels - order matters
!> chunk only prints first vowel...maybe reading first position of array only...may need to reduce vowels-per-frame
