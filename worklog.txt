ok good    cnjAssimilativeVerb( word );
ok good     cnjHollowVerb( word ); //control by arSubject, not suffix sukkun sniifer
ok good     doubled

ok mostly   cnjDefective - present tense has ar_A/ar_a & ar_U/ar_u for last chars of pro_he; imperfect is worse (U/u)
ok mostly   hamza - alif-madda collapse ok, check hamza carrier rules

~~          cnjUltraHollowVerb( word ) - not tested
done not tested     verb form 8 post-processing...
done not tested     new model nouns

Needs
    <general>
        no   do not want. vowels as part of base form (voweling specified in 5 of 10 forms) or cnjVerb (meh)
        ok   rename verbType to conjType?  to accomodate usage for nouns
        ok     css - restrict chosen lists to single column, h-align chosen elements within div.  Reason for fault was CSS from jQ ui tabs was overriding chosen CSS.
        ok   Regression on divFooter alerts for irregular verbs.  Floating overlay fixed.
        ok   union query of both backend tabs-done!
        !!   what's up with      أيد   ?
        ??   VOWELS
                hollow - use hyphens as filler for both vowels to suppress error message
                defective -
                doubled - NEED rad2 vowel for youM/F & theyF
                are hyphens still needed as filler (why not be smart)?  vowel rad2 vowel - shorter field name (ok)

    <verbs>
        ?    add trailing fatha to suffix for pro_theyM?
        ok   jussive
        ok    imperative
        ok    dual tenses > coded dual you, and dual they M...need dual they F?

    <nouns>
        -   masdar form 8 - for assimilative
        ~~  validate more masdar patterns to form 1
        ~~  validate more masdar patterns to form 2
        ~~  validate irregular masdar for forms 4-10
        ok  add irregular masdar for forms 4-10
        ok   masdar form 2/5 - don't over-shadda
        ok  masdar form 10 - use pop/push to fix vowel over ta
        ok   irregulars > allow 2 char masdar code
        ok  add more masdar patterns to form 1
        ok  add more masdar patterns to form 2

  old notes below

nice to have
-? segmentate (9) Suffix < OuterLeft < R3 < InnerLeft < R2 < InnerRight < R1 < OuterRight < Prefix
- constants as one big object? or lotsa small vars? ar_A vs r.A vs ar.A vs r.translit(a,r,b)

-core logic
    - QA
        >>   QA irregulars in forms after 1
        OK   squelch prefix/suffix on null forms (i.e. form 7 passives, recipient)
        >    function conjPassivePast(root, formNum) // form 9
        OK   implement word object in earlier irregular functions? ... show user type of irregular verb?
        OK   nouns.js remove -  Unreachable 'break' after 'return'.
        OK   chunk (v4) to parse vowels & markings...need for debugging doubled verbs, catching vowel surplus in other use-cases
                ok   > compare output short vowels to exemplars; trace discrepancies
        OK   have option to print ALL conjugations from all subjects
        OK   Added codes for form1 masdar; cleaned up code for form 2/3
        OK   regex match one of multiple unicode chars - collapse اا into آ
        OK   objRefs as global -- declare once before backend, and once after.
        OK   segment() function built...no application a.t.t.?

     > QA conjugations
        OK  assimilative verbs
>>          !  fix form 8 (also masdar broke) active present outputs يَتَصِلُ
                    ...should be يَتَواصِل

        OK  hollow verbs ?
            OK regulars in active tenses
            OK irregular in active tenses
            OK? later past tenses have beginning of stem chopped off / USE String.Prototype.replaceAt() vs char position of root
                String.prototype.replaceAt=function(index, char) {return this.substr(0, index) + char + this.substr(index+char.length);}
                Line806
            OK (auto-squelched) passive tenses have doubled vowels

        ~ defective verbs ?
            OK in present tense, need to prune lead char of suffix
>> resume >>  ?? past tense, especially they x2

        > doubled verbs ?
            OK form 1  -- rad 2 takes place of shadda
            ?? later forms - need more data to validate...dupe vowels squelched
            !! NOUN conj needs to stay regular in form2/5

        ~ hamza verbs ?
            change vowel to match consonant, or hamza consonant to match preceeding vowel (grammatical!) - check hollow present logic

-styling/css
    OK   style chosen select x 2.  hide search on subject.  increase height & width.  add label.
    OK   tweak CSS from js console w/ jQ, then lock in

-backend / data quality
    - SQL join / js to combine & de-dupe both sheets...translations not read if backend has a dupe
    - on 500
        - defective - write Ya, not alif maqsura
        - doubled - using shadda on orig (write out both on 500)
        - quadrilateral (offload to separate sheet a.t.t.)
        - جوب - two meanings/rad2 conjugations in form 10
ok  write out cheat card for data entry - esp. masdar codes...document on git read.me too?

- data quality standards
    - doubled roots get shadda as rad3, not a repeat of rad2
    - roots that get hyphens for form 1 vowels: hollow, doubled
    - data entry for imperative
    - QA/QC conjugations for typos

-secondary features
    - within tense conjugation (i.e. for all subjects; add column on left)
